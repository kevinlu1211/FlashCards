## What is it?


> FlashCards is a simple app that allows uses to add cards to a deck and then they are able to test themselves using the cards that they have created.

## Usage
On the initial landing page you there is a Library with an Add button on the top right hand side for you to create a subject.

After your subject is created it will appear and clicking on it will take you where you can create a deck via the same way (by clicking on the Add button on the top right hand side)

After your deck is created you can click on it and it will take you to a view that allows you to add cards to your deck.You will also be able to test yourself on the cards that you have created.

## Adding cards to your deck
Right now there is only automatic fill-in for Chinese (although I will be adding support for more languages in the future).

To use this: 

Write any Chinese word that you want the meaning of e.g. 人家 and press the Search button on the button of the view that creates cards. The pronunciation and definition text views will load automatically (via scraping the source code of a website). If the word has more than one definition/pronunciation you will be able to cycle through them until you find the desired one.
